What is Reverse Image Search?
You input a photo to this search engine and the search result returns all the images relevant to the query image. What images are relevant? It depends on the usage scenario and what are you trying to achieve. When a user enters an image of a black shoe, are you trying to find similar shoe or an image with overall similar color composition. When a user enters an image of a person with great mountain range as the backdrop, are you focusing on the mountain or the person or the overall color composition? So the defintion of relevant or similar image depends on the usage scenario.
